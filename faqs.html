    <p>
        Tired of trying to find a media manager for your DVDs, Blu-Rays and Downloads?<br/><br/>
        I was... The ones I found we either too expensive or had too much than one can manage.<br/><br/>
        So I decided to build one, open source, so anyone can use and extend as needed (with due credit ofcourse).<br/><br/>
        So enjoy collecting and managing your movies and tv series...<br/><br/>
